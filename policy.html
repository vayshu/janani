        <h4>1. What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
        <p>
        <strong>(a) Information You Provide To Us</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Personal Information.</strong>
        We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, and mobile number ("
        <strong>Personal Information</strong>
        "). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places through the Services, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the Services, you create a user profile. The current required data fields are:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li> Email </li>
        <li> Password </li>
        <li> Name </li>
        <li> Mobile Phone Number </li>
        <li> Zip Code </li>
        <li> Credit Card Number, expiration date & security code and or information regarding your PayPal, Google Wallet or other digital payment accounts </li>
        </ul>
        <p> If you choose to upload a photo when registering for our Services, the photo may be viewable by us and by the drivers who are picking you up so that they are able to verify your identity. You may remove or update the photo at any time by logging into your account. </p>
        <p>
        <strong>(b) Information We Collect As You Access And Use Our Services</strong>
        </p>

        <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services (" Usage Information"). This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Services, all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purpose , including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (" Device Identifier") for your computer, mobile or other device used to access the Services (any, a "Device"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information. </p> 

        <p>In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our Services, including, but not limited to geographic areas. If you are traveling in a vehicle requested via our Services, the driver's mobile phone will send your GPS coordinates, during the ride, to our servers. Most GPS enabled mobile devices can define one's location to within 50 feet. We collect this information for various purposes - including to determine the charge for the transportation you requested via our Services, to provide you with support, to send you promotions and offers, to enhance our Services, and for our internal business purposes. We may also have features that allow you to share this information with other people (such as your family, friends or colleagues) if you choose. </p>

        <p>For example, when you choose to split the fare for a trip with other users, all users splitting the fare can see the GPS coordinates recorded by the driver's mobile phone for that particular trip, as well as certain information about the users (such as the User's name and photos) who have agreed to split the fare for that trip.</p>

        <p>A few of the methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed):</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to access the Services. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website. </p>

        <p>If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly or may not be able to customize the delivery of information to you. </p>

        <p>You should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third-parties, and use of third party cookies is not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web and mobile pages and messages. The web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored in a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons or similar technologies help us better manage content on our Services by informing us what content is effective, count users of the Services, monitor how users navigate the Services, count how many e-mails that we send were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to your personal information. </p>

        <p><strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

        <p>
        <strong>(c) Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong>
        </p>

        <p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you through our web site or Mobile Application with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise. </p>

        <p>
        <strong>(d) Information You Provide About A Third Party</strong>
        </p>

        <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Services or a job position, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Services. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program, and do not use this information for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality through our Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>

        <p>If you choose to split a trip fare, we will ask you for your friend's mobile number. We will send your friend a text message informing him or her that you have requested that he or she split the fare for a trip. Your friend may accept or decline your request to split your fare. We will not use this information for any marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. </p>

        <p>Your friend may contact us through t.Whistle.com/support to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

        <p>
        <strong>(e) Information Collected by Mobile Applications</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Our Services are primarily provided through an application on your mobile, tablet computer or similar device ("Mobile Application"). You agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to such Mobile Applications. </p>

        <p>When you use any of our Mobile Applications, the Mobile Application may automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your mobile device ("Mobile Device Information"), including without limitation: </p>

                </ul>
                <p> </p>
                <li> The type of mobile Internet browsers you are using. </li>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                <li> Your geolocation. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> </p>
                <li> Information about how you interact with the Mobile Application and any of our web sites to which the Mobile Application links, such as how many times you use a specific part of the mobile application over a given time period, the amount of time you spend using the Mobile Application, how often you use the Mobile Application, actions you take in the Mobile Application and how you engage with the Mobile Application. </li>
                <p></p>
                <p> </p>
                <li> Information to allow us to personalize the services and content available through the Mobile Application. </li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>

                <p> With respect to geo-location data we track through your Mobile Device, we use that geo-location information for various purposes - including for you to be able to view the drivers in your area that are close to your location, for you to set your pick up location, so the drivers are able to find the location from which you wish to be picked up, to send you promotions and offers, and to allow you (if you choose through any features we may provide) to share this information with other people. Except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy, we will not share this information with third parties for any purpose and will only use this information for the sole purpose of providing you with the ability to request transportation via Whistle's Mobile Application. You may at any time no longer allow our Mobile Application to use your location by turning this feature off at the Mobile Device level. </p>
                <p> We also provide some of your Personal Information (such as your first name and your photo, if you have chosen to upload your photo to your profile) to the driver/partner who accepts your request for transportation so that the driver may contact and find you, and to those users with whom you have agreed to split the fare for a particular trip.

                <h4>4. What is Online Behavioral Advertising and How Can I Opt-Out?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p> Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web or mobile browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than our web site(s). For example, if you have shown a preference for nursing while visiting our web site(s), you may be served an advertisement for nursing-related programs when you visit a site other than our web site(s). The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from us or through third party website publishers. </p>
                <p>
                If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from us that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please
                <a href="#">
                <strong>click here</strong>
                </a>
                to access the NAI Opt-Out Page. Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from our Company and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you may continue to receive online advertising from us; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.
                </p>
                <p> In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your Device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new Device, access our Services from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled. </p>
                <p> Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies. </p>

                <p></p>

                <p> Our online and mobile Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets such as a "Share This" button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our online and mobile Services. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our online or mobile Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our online Services. Your interactions with these features and widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them. </p>

                <h4>9. What Should Parents Know About Children?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                The Company cares about the safety of children. Because our Services are not directed toward minors, no one under 18 (and certainly no children under 13) are allowed to register with or use the Services. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a person under 18, we will delete that information immediately. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor under the age of eighteen (18) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at

                <h4>10. What About Security?</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p> The Personal Information and Usage Information we collect is securely stored within our databases, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information - such as any portions of your credit card number which we retain (we do not ourselves retain your entire credit card information) and geo-location information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or wireless communication, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone. </p>

Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. </p>

                <h4>12. Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
                <p></p>
                <p> California's "Shine the Light" law, California Civil Code § 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from individuals in California (those who have an established business relationship with us) asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose your personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes unless you first affirmatively agree to the disclosure (opt-in) or if you have exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing (opt-out). </p>
                <p> We have opted for this alternative approach, and we do not share your personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes unless you provide us with permission at the time you provide such information. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <h4>13. What About Consent To Transfer Information To The United States?</h4>
