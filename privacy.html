<h2>How we use Cookies</h2>

<p class="P4">A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on the User’s
computer's or mobile’s hard drive. Once the User agree, the file is
added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets the User know
when he/ she visit a particular site. Cookies allow mobile applications
to respond to the User as an individual. The mobile application can
tailor its operations to the User’s needs, likes and dislikes by
gathering and remembering information about the User’s preferences. We
use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This
helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our Whistle App

for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the
system.</p>

<p class="P4">Overall, cookies help us provide the
User with a better Whistle App, by enabling us to monitor which pages
the User find useful and which the User do not. A cookie in no way gives
us access to the User’s computer or any information about the User,
other than the data the User choose to share with us. The User can
choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but the User can usually modify the User’s browser
setting to decline cookies if the User prefer. This may prevent the User
from taking full advantage of the Whistle App.</p>
