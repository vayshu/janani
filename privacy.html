<h2>How we use Cookies</h2>
<p class="P4">A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on the User’s
 computer's or mobile’s hard drive. Once the User agree, the file is 
added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets the User know 
when he/ she visit a particular site. Cookies allow mobile applications 
to respond to the User as an individual. The mobile application can 
tailor its operations to the User’s needs, likes and dislikes by 
gathering and remembering information about the User’s preferences. We 
use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This 
helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our Whistle App
 in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information 
for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the 
system.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="P4">Overall, cookies help us provide the 
User with a better Whistle App, by enabling us to monitor which pages 
the User find useful and which the User do not. A cookie in no way gives
 us access to the User’s computer or any information about the User, 
other than the data the User choose to share with us. The User can 
choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically 
accept cookies, but the User can usually modify the User’s browser 
setting to decline cookies if the User prefer. This may prevent the User
 from taking full advantage of the Whistle App.</p>

 Whistle App may contain links to other websites of interest or to other
 third party sites, such as payment gateways. However, once the User 
have used these links to leave our Whistle App, the User should note

cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information 
which the User provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not
